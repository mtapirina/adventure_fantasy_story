# Create a Fantasy Adventure Game

Create an action-adventure style fantasy story in Phaser using click events! Codecademy, Phaser JS

### Creating the Game!

We’re going to be developing an interactive storytelling game with orcs, knights and wizards! Our first step is going to be adding in a create() function to our Phaser project.

* Create a background by adding the image.
* Let’s create a new function for rendering a character. 
_This will update the image inside our background with the image of the relevant character who is speaking._
* Creating a Dialogue!

_Now that we’re displaying our characters correctly, let’s focus on adding playability to our game._
* Displaying Each Page To Make Our Adventure Game!
* Make Interaction Noticeable With Hover States.
* Now update the dialogue, and the option text too! 
_When you reload the game, do you see what you expected!_
